# Store Manager üè™

This project represents my successful journey in building a dropshipping sales management RESTful API. Throughout the development of this project, I acquired various crucial skills related to web development and creating a robust architecture.

## Key Achievements

Here are some of the main achievements and learnings I gained during this project:

### MSC Architecture (Model-Service-Controller)

- **Model**: I learned to create the Model layer to handle data access and manipulation in the MySQL database. This included implementing functions such as `findAll`, `findById`, `insert`, and more. I also focused on writing unit tests to ensure the reliability of these functions.

- **Service**: In the Service layer, I implemented the business logic of the application. This involved functions like `createProduct`, `createSale`, and others, where I validated data using the Joi module and created reliable return contracts. Once again, unit tests played a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of these functions.

- **Controller**: In the Controller layer, I mapped routes to their respective functions and handled HTTP requests. This included functions like `listProducts`, `updateProduct`, and so on. Here, I also focused on specific validations in the Controller layer and wrote corresponding tests.

### MySQL Database and Docker

- I became familiar with integrating Node.js with the MySQL database, enabling efficient data management.

- I learned to use Docker and docker-compose to create development environments with separate containers for the application and the database.

### Unit Testing

- I developed a solid practice of writing unit tests for each layer of the application, ensuring that functionalities remained reliable and bug-free.

### REST Pattern

- I applied the REST pattern in building the API, ensuring a uniform and intuitive interface for interactions with the application.

## Requirements Met

During the completion of this project, I met a series of requirements, demonstrating my ability to create a robust and thoroughly tested application. Some of the requirements include:

- Listing products and sales.
- Registering and validating products and sales.
- Updating and deleting products.
- Searching products by terms.
- Coverage of unit tests across various layers of the application.
